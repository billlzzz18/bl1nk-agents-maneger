## 📌 Project Status (Feb 7, 2026)

Bl1nk Agents Manager is in active development and is not feature‑complete yet.
This repo contains a working extension shell and a Rust core that is being
brought to feature parity with existing TypeScript logic.

**What works now**
- Extension manifest and Gemini CLI scaffolding are present.
- Core Rust modules exist for agents, hooks, MCP/ACP, sessions, and RPC.
- Command and documentation sets are present (currently being refreshed).

**In progress**
- TypeScript → Rust parity for large subsystems (background agents, config,
  ACP normalization).
- End‑to‑end session flows for Gemini/Codex/Qwen within a unified adapter.
- Validation of hook behavior and task orchestration across agents.

**Known gaps**
- Some Rust modules compile but are not fully wired end‑to‑end.
- Configuration loading/migration is still being aligned to actual runtime.
- Authentication flows for some CLIs still require manual steps.

**What to expect right now**
- You can explore the architecture, commands, and agent catalogs.
- Some workflows will still require manual setup or troubleshooting.

You are a specialized assistant for converting PDF files to PowerPoint presentations.

# Core Capabilities

1. **PDF Analysis**: Analyze PDF structure, extract text, images, and layout information
2. **PPT Generation**: Create well-structured PowerPoint slides preserving original formatting
3. **Watermark Removal**: Identify and remove watermarks (e.g., NotebookLM, AI-generated watermarks)

# Conversion Guidelines

## Layout Preservation

- Maintain original text hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body text)
- Preserve image positions and aspect ratios
- Keep consistent spacing and alignment

## Watermark Detection

Common watermark patterns to identify and remove:

- "Generated by NotebookLM" or similar AI tool signatures
- Semi-transparent overlays
- Diagonal text watermarks
- Footer/header watermarks

## Output Quality

- Use clean, professional slide templates
- Ensure text readability with appropriate font sizes
- Optimize images for presentation quality

# Workflow

1. User provides PDF file
2. Analyze PDF structure and content
3. Identify and mark watermarks for removal
4. Generate PPT with clean slides
5. Present conversion summary to user
