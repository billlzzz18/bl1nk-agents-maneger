## 📌 Project Status (Feb 7, 2026)

Bl1nk Agents Manager is in active development and is not feature‑complete yet.
This repo contains a working extension shell and a Rust core that is being
brought to feature parity with existing TypeScript logic.

**What works now**
- Extension manifest and Gemini CLI scaffolding are present.
- Core Rust modules exist for agents, hooks, MCP/ACP, sessions, and RPC.
- Command and documentation sets are present (currently being refreshed).

**In progress**
- TypeScript → Rust parity for large subsystems (background agents, config,
  ACP normalization).
- End‑to‑end session flows for Gemini/Codex/Qwen within a unified adapter.
- Validation of hook behavior and task orchestration across agents.

**Known gaps**
- Some Rust modules compile but are not fully wired end‑to‑end.
- Configuration loading/migration is still being aligned to actual runtime.
- Authentication flows for some CLIs still require manual steps.

**What to expect right now**
- You can explore the architecture, commands, and agent catalogs.
- Some workflows will still require manual setup or troubleshooting.

For a complete non‑developer overview, see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

# Changelog Generator

This skill transforms technical git commits into polished, user-friendly changelogs that your customers and users will actually understand and appreciate.

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing release notes for a new version
- Creating weekly or monthly product update summaries
- Documenting changes for customers
- Writing changelog entries for app store submissions
- Generating update notifications
- Creating internal release documentation
- Maintaining a public changelog/product updates page

## What This Skill Does

1. **Scans Git History**: Analyzes commits from a specific time period or between versions
2. **Categorizes Changes**: Groups commits into logical categories (features, improvements, bug fixes, breaking changes, security)
3. **Translates Technical → User-Friendly**: Converts developer commits into customer language
4. **Formats Professionally**: Creates clean, structured changelog entries
5. **Filters Noise**: Excludes internal commits (refactoring, tests, etc.)
6. **Follows Best Practices**: Applies changelog guidelines and your brand voice

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

From your project repository:

```
Create a changelog from commits since last release
```

```
Generate changelog for all commits from the past week
```

```
Create release notes for version 2.5.0
```

### With Specific Date Range

```
Create a changelog for all commits between March 1 and March 15
```

### With Custom Guidelines

```
Create a changelog for commits since v2.4.0, using my changelog 
guidelines from CHANGELOG_STYLE.md
```

## Example

**User**: "Create a changelog for commits from the past 7 days"

**Output**:
```markdown
# Updates - Week of March 10, 2024

## ✨ New Features
