## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` for new features
- `fix/description` for bug fixes
- `docs/description` for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` for refactoring
- `perf/description` for performance improvements
- `test/description` for test additions

### Commit Messages

We follow the conventional commits specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`

Examples:

```
feat(agent): add new architect agent with XML prompting
fix(cli): resolve issue with agent switching command
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(core): improve agent loading performance
test(core): add unit tests for agent routing
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Guidelines

- Follow Rust idioms and best practices
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document public APIs with `///` comments
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Follow the principle of least surprise

### Python Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use descriptive variable names

### Best Practices

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow SOLID principles
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when making changes

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Unit tests required for new features
- Integration tests for API changes
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Rust tests
just test

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --package bl1nk-core

# Run Python validation tests
python3 scripts/validate_agents.py

# Run tests with coverage (if available)
cargo test --all-features -- --include-ignored
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage on new functionality
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document public APIs with comprehensive comments
- Include examples where helpful
- Explain complex algorithms
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### README Updates

- Update documentation for new features
- Add examples for new functionality
- Update configuration options and usage instructions

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- Run tests locally (`just test`)
- Run linter (`just clippy`)
- Update documentation as needed
- Self-review your code changes
- Ensure your changes work as expected

## Adding New Agents

If you're adding a new agent to the library:

1. Create a new markdown file in `agents/` directory
2. Include proper YAML frontmatter with required metadata:

```yaml
---
id: my-new-agent
name: My New Agent
description: A brief description of what this agent does
category: utility
cost: FREE
triggers: ["specific", "keywords", "that", "trigger", "this", "agent"]
---
```

1. Add the system prompt content after the frontmatter
2. Add agent to `agents/agents.json` registry
3. Run `just validate-agents` to ensure your agent is properly formatted
4. Test the agent by running `/system-agent` and verifying it appears in the list

## Adding New Hooks

If you're adding a new hook to the system:

1. Create a new module in `crates/core/src/hooks/`
2. Implement the hook interface:

```rust
pub struct MyHook {
    // Hook state
}

impl MyHook {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { /* ... */ }
    }
    
    pub async fn process(&self, context: &Context) -> Result<()> {
        // Hook logic
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

1. Export in `crates/core/src/hooks/mod.rs`:

```rust
pub mod my_hook;
pub use my_hook::{create_my_hook, MyHook};
```

1. Add tests for the hook
