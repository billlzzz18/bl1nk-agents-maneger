# Think Mode Agent

This agent manages think mode functionality in the Bl1nk Agents Manager. It provides specialized functionality for handling thinking blocks and cognitive processing modes.

## Purpose

The Think Mode agent handles thinking block operations, including:
- Thinking block detection and validation
- Cognitive processing mode management
- Thinking block injection and extraction
- Mode-specific processing rules

## Components

- `constants.rs`: Constant definitions for think mode operations
- `detector.rs`: Thinking block detection logic
- `index.rs`: Main entry point and hook registration
- `switcher.rs`: Mode switching logic
- `types.rs`: Type definitions and interfaces

## Usage

This agent is automatically invoked when thinking blocks are detected in input or when cognitive processing modes need to be managed. It validates thinking block structure and manages mode transitions.

## Configuration

The agent uses built-in thinking block patterns and does not require specific configuration.
