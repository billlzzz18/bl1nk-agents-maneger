# Anthropic Context Window Limit Recovery Agent

This agent manages recovery from context window limit errors for Anthropic models in the Bl1nk Agents Manager. It provides intelligent truncation and recovery mechanisms when token limits are exceeded.

## Purpose

The Anthropic Context Window Limit Recovery agent handles situations where Anthropic model requests exceed context window limits, providing:
- Automatic token limit error detection
- Intelligent content truncation strategies
- Recovery mechanisms to continue operations
- Preservation of important context information

## Components

- `executor.rs`: Core execution logic for recovery operations
- `index.rs`: Main entry point and hook registration
- `parser.rs`: Token limit error parsing and analysis
- `pruning_deduplication.rs`: Content deduplication and optimization
- `pruning_types.rs`: Type definitions for pruning operations
- `storage.rs`: Storage and retrieval of truncated content
- `types.rs`: Core type definitions and interfaces

## Usage

This agent is automatically invoked when Anthropic model requests encounter context window limit errors. It attempts to recover by intelligently truncating less important content while preserving critical context.

## Configuration

The agent uses built-in recovery strategies and does not require specific configuration. It operates based on detected token limit errors.
